These are all GET methods:

####### From outer VM:

/<filepath:re:.*\..*> #anything with a dot in it somewhere serves a static file from server PWD


####### From inner (MINIX) VM:
/hexdump/?path=absolute_path                                        # hexdump results for a particular file
/cat/?path=absolute_path                                            # cat results for a particular file
/tree/?path=absolute_path?maxdepth=depth_limit                      # maxdepth arg optional. Gives your tree results in JSON format

/arbitrary_command/?command=command_string&return_result=true/false # run any command. set return_result to true if you want to see the results. otherwise returns "done"

/filter/?script_name=script_name&dev_names=[dev_name]               # Specify the script's name and 1 or more device names. Returns {"RtL": [paths], "LtR": [paths]} as specified by script behaviour. Not implemented yet
# the following 3 are on the chopping block once /filter above is implemented
/diff?dir1=dir1=full_path_to_dir1&dir2=full_path_to_dir2            # returns diff of two directories (dirs, files, and symlinks checked currently. other files will be missed. TODO: depending on response from Cristiano & Herbert about actual "diff" program working in /peek, behaviour may change). Returns same dict structure as /filter
/memleaks?dev_name=dev_name                                         # gives you a list of files in .dynamic dir corresponding to memleaks in LtR key of dict
/bad_pointers?dev_name=dev_name                                     # gives you a list of symlinks pointing to .ptr/invalid in LtR key of dict

/restart                                                            # graceful restart
/connection_status                                                  # returns {"alive": true/false}


/immediateresponse                                                  # gives you an immediate response
/sleep_test/20                                                      # waits x (20 in example) seconds and then returns "SLEPT x secs"
/crash_server                                                       # crashes the server
/kill_running_trees                                                 # kills all running tree instances on MINIX machine
